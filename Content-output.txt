Okay, here is a summarization table comparing AI, Generative AI (Gen AI), and Agentic AI. These terms represent different levels of breadth and specific capabilities within the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Think of it like this: **AI** is the vast ocean. **Generative AI** is a specific powerful current within that ocean that *creates* things. **Agentic AI** is a ship sailing in that ocean (potentially using those currents) with the ability to *plan, navigate, and act* autonomously to reach a destination (a goal).

Here's the table:

| Feature / Concept      | Artificial Intelligence (AI)                   | Generative AI (Gen AI)                             | Agentic AI                                          |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**              | The broad field/concept of machines simulating human intelligence. | A specific *type* or *application* within AI.      | A specific *type* or *architecture* within AI, often building on others. |
| **Primary Focus / Core Function** | Simulating human cognitive functions (learning, reasoning, perception, problem-solving). | Creating novel content (text, images, code, music, etc.) based on learned patterns. | Achieving specific goals by planning, executing actions, and interacting with an environment. |
| **Key Capabilities**   | Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Planning, Reasoning, Expert Systems. | Pattern recognition, data generation, synthesis, creativity (in terms of novelty), understanding and manipulating complex data structures (like language, images). | Planning, task decomposition, tool usage, environment interaction (digital/physical), goal monitoring, iterative refinement, autonomous execution. |
| **Relationship**       | The overarching field.                       | A *subset* of AI focused on content generation.    | Can be a *subset* of AI. Often *leverages* Gen AI and other AI capabilities (like planning, perception) to enable goal-directed action. |
| **Typical Output**     | Decisions, predictions, classifications, analysis, insights, performance of specific tasks (e.g., recognizing objects, translating language). | Generated content: essays, stories, code snippets, images, music tracks, synthetic data. | Completed tasks, achieved goals, sequences of actions taken, interactions with external systems/APIs, solutions to multi-step problems. |
| **Level of Autonomy / Action** | Varies widely. Can be reactive or proactive depending on the system, but not inherently designed for independent, multi-step goal pursuit in complex environments without explicit task definitions. | Generally low autonomy; reactive to prompts to generate content. Does not *act* autonomously in the world to achieve external goals. | High potential for autonomy (within defined constraints/goals); proactive in planning and executing steps, interacting with the environment to reach an objective. Designed to *act*. |
| **Examples**           | Traditional Machine Learning models (for classification, regression), Expert Systems, Robotics (control systems), Standard NLP (sentiment analysis, translation). | Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, Bard, Claude; Image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion; AI music generators. | Early prototypes like AutoGPT/BabyAGI concepts, AI systems controlling complex robots for multi-stage tasks, sophisticated virtual assistants capable of complex multi-step actions (like booking a trip end-to-end), autonomous financial trading agents. |

In essence:

*   **AI** is the foundational concept of intelligent machines.
*   **Gen AI** is a specific capability *within* AI focused on *creating* new things.
*   **Agentic AI** is an architectural approach or paradigm *within* AI that focuses on building systems capable of *acting* autonomously to achieve defined goals, often *using* Gen AI and other AI capabilities as tools.
