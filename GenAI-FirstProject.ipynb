      "| Feature / Concept | AI (Artificial Intelligence) | Generative AI (GenAI) | Agentic AI |\n",
      "|---|---|---|---|\n",
      "| **Scope** | **Broadest:** The entire field of making machines perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. | **Subset of AI:** Specifically focused on creating new content. | **Layered on AI (often GenAI):** Refers to systems that can act autonomously to achieve goals. |\n",
      "| **Primary Goal** | To mimic or achieve human-like cognitive functions (learning, problem-solving, perception, etc.). | To create novel and diverse outputs (text, images, code, audio, video, etc.). | To achieve a specific objective through independent planning, action, and interaction with an environment or tools. |\n",
      "| **Key Capability / Output** | Decision-making, learning, problem-solving, pattern recognition, classification, prediction. Can include *many* things. | Generating new content based on learned patterns from data. Outputs *content*. | Planning complex tasks, breaking them down, executing steps, using tools/APIs, interacting with external systems, self-correction. Outputs are *actions* leading to a *result*. |\n",
      "| **Autonomy / Agency** | Varies greatly, often low or limited to specific tasks. Not a defining characteristic. | Low. Typically reacts to a prompt to generate output. Does not plan or act autonomously beyond generation. | High. Designed to act independently, make decisions about steps, and execute sequences of actions without constant human input for each step. This is the *defining* characteristic. |\n",
      "| **Interaction** | Can be interactive or background. Depends on the specific AI application. | Primarily takes input (prompt) and provides output (generated content). Limited interaction with external environments/tools. | Actively interacts with external systems, databases, websites, APIs, software tools, and potentially the physical world to accomplish its goal. |\n",
      "| **Relationship** | The overarching field. | A specific *type* or *application* of AI focused on creation. | An *architecture* or *paradigm* often built *on top of* or *using* underlying AI capabilities (like GenAI for reasoning), focused on autonomous action. |\n",
      "| **Typical Examples** | Spam filters, recommendation systems, expert systems, image recognition, simple chatbots, robotic process automation (RPA). | ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot, text-to-speech models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). | AI systems that can autonomously browse the web for research, plan and execute coding projects, manage complex workflows involving multiple tools, or act as advanced personal assistants coordinating tasks across applications. |\n",

There are distinct darker areas, possibly sections of open water or very thin ice, which contrast sharply with the lighter, textured ice. The patterns on the ice are highly varied, including wavy lines, concentric circles, and fractal-like designs, creating a unique and artistic natural tapestry.\n",
